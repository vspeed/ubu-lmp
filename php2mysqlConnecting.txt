# PHP connecting to databse
# PHP can be used to connect to the database the user info and password must be stored away in a locaton that is not available to the general public. That would be bad to be left outside in general access. Inorder to do this store the file that has the secret chaaters up one level from the "public_html" also known as Document Root

# Create a file that has the command to connect to the mysql database. This file should contain the parrameters for connecting usernaem password and database. create the file and call it connect_db.php

# Connect on 'localhost' for user 'chief'
# with password 'Password#1234567890' to database 'site_db'

$dbc = mysqli_connect
('localhost' , 'chief' , 'Password#1234567890' , 'site_db')
OR die
(mysqli_connect_error() ) ;
# Set encoding to match PHP script encoding.
mysqli_set_charset( $dbc , 'utf8' )

Create another file that can be seen by the public and call it require.php

<?php
# Incorporate the MySQL connection script
require ( '../connect_db.php' ) ;

# Display MySQL version and host
if ( mysqli_ping( $dbc ))
{ echo 'MySQL Server ' .mysqli_get_server_info( $dbc ).
' on ' .mysqli_get_host_info( $dbc ) ;}
