After downloading and extracting the image file "img.xz" use "rufus" to write image to sd card.
Boot up RPi should take 45 before graphics kick in.
after 2 minutes user should ahve the ability to log in.
default user naem and password is "ubuntu"
after loggin in you are forced to chage the password. enter the original password again"ubuntu" then enter the new password it must be done twice to confirm accuracy.
afte this is done ssh access is available. just run ifconfig to see ip address.
change the hostname so that errors do not occur
vi /etc/hostname the file shoul dcontain whatever name you want to be
next vi /etc/hosts add localhost.localdomain and localhostadd aditional line 127.0.0.1 then tab over and input perfered hostname. Changes take effect after reboot
